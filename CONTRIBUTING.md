   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run checks locally:**

   ```bash

- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
- Be responsive to review feedback

## Project Structure

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md) for detailed system design.

```
src/
├── config/          # Environment and tenant configuration
├── dashboard/       # Web dashboard and API
├── linear/          # Linear API client with rate limiting
├── logger/          # Structured JSON logging
├── memory/          # Cross-session learning storage
├── notifications/   # Multi-provider notification system
├── prompts/         # Agent prompt templates
├── server/          # Express server and webhooks
├── spawner/         # Agent pool and queue management
├── tracking/        # Cost and token tracking
├── validation/      # Test/lint/typecheck pipeline
└── watcher/         # Webhook and polling handlers
```

## Testing

- **Unit tests:** Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests:** Test interactions between components
- **E2E tests:** Test full workflows (webhook → agent → PR)

Run tests:

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage       # With coverage report
```

### Coverage Requirements

All PRs must maintain a minimum **70% coverage** threshold for:

- Statements
- Branches
- Functions
- Lines

The CI will fail if coverage drops below this threshold.

## Code Style

- We use TypeScript with strict mode
- ESLint and Prettier for formatting
- Run `npm run lint` before committing

## Questions?

- Open a discussion on GitHub
- Check existing issues and discussions first
